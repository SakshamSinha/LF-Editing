# Light Field Editing

The Light Field Editing project includes code suitable to edit light fields. This project will provide code for light field super-resolution, inpainting, denoising and others. This repository will include recent algorithms found in literature including methods being developed by our team.


Installation
------------

* You have to install matconvnet and include the matconvnet library into the folder MATLAB/
* Store all the light fields in a directory ../LF-DATASET/. We consider here four different datasets
